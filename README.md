# Work-Scheduler
In this challenge the title is Work-scheduler. Not only did I learn how to make and create a Calander on google but It taught me a lot more about Java and CSS. I see were im strong and were im still a bit weak at.
This challenge was started from a starter code so the code is a bit different than the original due to the scout rule.
